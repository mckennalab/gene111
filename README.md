### Course Description

This course provides an introduction to computational biology and bioinformatics, with a focus on the methods and approaches used for sequence analysis. We will describe common string search approaches, alignment methods, dynamic programming techniques, as well as lightly explore hidden Markov models (HMMs) and other more complex methods. There will be programming homework assignments in Python as well as a number of mini-assignments, though no programming experience is required ( in that case, a strong willingness to learn is requested).

### Prerequisites

We aim to provide an introduction to both common computational methods as well as training in programming using good practices from software engineering. Given the wide range of backgrounds among students in this class, we will try to supplement main assignments with small exercises that familiarize students with Python, the command line, and sequencing data. 

### Reading Material

The core textbook of the class will be notes and primary literature, no book is required. If you’re looking for a book, we will loosely track Biological Sequence Analysis by Richard Durbin, Sean Eddy, Anders Krogh, and Graeme Mitchison. It’s an absolute classic, though it can be very terse at times, especially for those with a biology background. 

### Grading

The course grade is based on the homework assignments. There are no tests or exams. Assignments are all computational in nature and are organized using GitHub classroom. Assignments are to be your own; you can discuss abstract points with classmates but do not share implementation details. The goal of this class is to acquire a core understanding of the key concepts in the field, and the assignments are tailed to help you internalize these concepts. This only works if you do the assignments.
